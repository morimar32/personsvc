## Overview ##

This project is meant to be an example/reference of what a simple, straightforward, yet production-ready go microservice. How close it comes to achieving its goals is up for debate. 

#### 30,000 ft. view ####
The service is meant to be a gRPC service, but also supports REST endpoints along with supporting Swagger. All 3 are generated from the same `.proto` file via https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway. The generated REST routes through into the gRPC instances [as opposed to redundant implementations]. There is an attempt to structure the solution with hexagonal architecture [with an exception of that linear service-to-service dependency], and tries to follow naming conventions accordingly.

Interfaces are defined between the different layers, and the implementing types also create a factory function that follow inversion of control. There are two reasons for this: first, it does make for easier testability. Second, this seems like it would be a bit more familiar/comfortable for C# developers who may be reviewing and/or possibly implementing. Go doesn't seem to have good options for dependency injection, but the factory methods are straight forward and have the added benefit of causing a compiler error if a function gets added/changed to the interface that hasn't been updated in the implementing class [essentially enforcing an _explicit_ interface behavior].

The majority of the interactions have been abstracted out into the `Makefile` and can be invoked via [incomplete list]:
* `make generate` - generate code from the .proto file
* `make test` - run tests and code coverage
* `make docker` - kick off the docker image creation

The Docker image is built within docker itself, as part of multistage build. Currently this process requires go on the host _only_ because it uses `go mod vendor` to bring in private repos to be copied in. If the base build image was built with the appropriate access tokens, the building of the image could be done on a host without go at all. 

The building process will compile, then run tests, and will also fail if a certain threshold [defined within code] is not met. The static compiled binary is then compressed [via `upx`] and copied into a scratch-built image, along with a 2cnd binary [following the same process] that is a healthcheck. The service runs under a non-root user created during the multistage build. This user has no login capabilities, and no explicit password. The service also is meant to be run with all capabilities dropped. [`cap_drop: ALL`]. As of right now, the image size builds to 19.4mb, and runs in < 30mb RAM.

* emphasis on security/minimal exposure 
* targeting naive/simplistic approach for hexagonal architecture
* goal of _not_ committing generated code/artifacts
* self-contained build process
